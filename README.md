# SA2---Multi-Device-Application

The Brief

You are tasked to create a single-page web application, comprised of a responsive front-end written in HTML/CSS and a small back-end created using Node.js. It is up to you what your application will be. For example, it could be a storefront, a practical utility, or an interactive experience. But, you should discuss your idea with your tutor before you start to ensure it is within the scope of the brief.

The front-end should be responsive to at least phone and desktosp devices. You should demonstrate a solid grasp of responsive design principles, focusing on both visual clarity and user experience. The back-end should serve static content (e.g. stylesheets, images, etc) and implement at least one additional feature. For example, it might serve a dynamic webpage, use data from a database or web API, or allow users to “log-in” to access content. Your implementation should efficiently use modern web development techniques.

You must iteratively design, implement, and document your project. Your documentation should explain how and why you changed the application as you iterated, and provide clear evidence of the process. Evidence could include design wireframes, test plans, peer feedback, and GitHub commits. 


The Application

The Node.js project folder required to run your Multi-Device Application. This should be submitted to the corresponding folder in your GitHub repository. Guides on how to push your code to GitHub are provided on Minerva. If you are unsure, ask your tutor.

You should commit the package.json file but should not commit the node_modules folder. Your GitHub repository should be configured to do this by default. If you encounter issues, please contact your tutor.
